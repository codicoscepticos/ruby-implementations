* [Ruby.NET](https://code.google.com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/) - ([article](https://programmingzen.com/rubynet-is-dead/))
* [RubyGoLightly](https://github.com/feyeleanor/RubyGoLightly) - An experimental port of TinyRb to Google go, both as a means of learning go and exploring alternate approaches to implementing Ruby. Work is currently focused on the GoLightly VM.
* [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/) - IronRuby is a Open Source implementation of the Ruby programming language for .NET and Silverlight, heavily relying on Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime.
* [XRuby](https://code.google.com/p/xruby/) - XRuby is the first Ruby to Java compiler which compiles Ruby source code (.rb) to Java bytecode (.class). The parser is implemented in ANTLR, and we use ASM to emit java bytecode.
* [MetaRuby](https://github.com/seattlerb/metaruby) - Metaruby intends to implement ruby’s internals in ruby itself. Its implementation will use ruby2c to convert itself to C and bootstrap a new ruby binary. Metaruby should be fully compatible w/ Matz’s ruby.
  * [ruby2c](https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_to_c) - ruby2c is a subset of the metaruby project, which aims at rewriting ruby's internals in ruby. ruby2c is the translation module and can automatically translate a method into equivalent C code for a subset of ruby. Very BETA, but making rapid progress.
* [ludicrous](http://rubystuff.org/ludicrous/) - Ludicrous is a just-in-time compiler for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. Though still in the experimental stage, its performance is roughly on par with YARV (better in some benchmarks, though that may change as more features are added).
